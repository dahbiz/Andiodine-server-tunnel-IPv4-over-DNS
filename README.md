# Andiodine-server
Andiodine is a dns-tunneling solutions that allows you tunnel IPv4 data through a DNS server. This is very usable in different situations where internet access is blocked by a firewall, but DNS queries are not. In addition, Andiodine is excellent to bypass wifi logins, and secure your web traffic in public places! 

To create an Andiodine server you need:

       ✦ VPS server with IPv4 adress.
       ✦ Domain name that supports A and NS records.
       ✦ And follow the steps below.
     
## Configuring Domain name.

Suppose that *domain.com* is your domain name. 
  
  - Create an A record by pointing a subdomain  *subd1.domain.com* to your vps IP.
  - Create an NS record by pointing another subdomain  *subd2.domain.com* to subd1.domain.com.
  
Now everything is good!

## Configuring VPS.

SSH to your vps using the terminal or another ssh client and copy/paste the following commands
as root.

           ♯ sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
```          
### Firewall rules
           
           ♯ /sbin/iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE
           ♯ /sbin/iptables -A FORWARD -i eth0 -o dns0 -m state –state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
           ♯ /sbin/iptables -A FORWARD -i dns0 -o eth0 -j ACCEPT
           ♯ iptables-save > /etc/iptables.rules
           
### Run Andiodine in the background

           ♯ iodined -f -c -m 1280 -DDDDD -P 9999 10.0.0.1 subd2.domain.com &
           
**9999** is the password, you can change it.
